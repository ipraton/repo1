            The derivative <m>f'(a)</m> of a function <m>f</m> at the point <m>x=a</m> is defined as
            <me>
              f'(a) = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}.
            </me>
            Let <m>f(x)=x^2+2x</m>.
            Find <m>f'(1)</m> and use it to find the equation of the tangent line to the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> at <m>x=1</m>.

            Here is the graph of a function <m>g(x)</m>.
            Determine the values of <m>x</m> where <m>g'(x)</m> is positive, negative, and zero (make sure you do this first!), and use it to sketch a graph of <m>g'(x)</m>.
